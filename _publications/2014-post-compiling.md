We present a compiler for CAO, an imperative DSL for the cryptographic domain.
The tool takes high-level cryptographic algorithm specifications and translates
them into C implementations through a series of security-aware transformations
and optimizations. The compiler back-end is highly configurable, allowing the
targeting of very disparate platforms in terms of memory requirements and
computing power.
