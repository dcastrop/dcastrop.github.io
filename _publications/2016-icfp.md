The increasing importance of parallelism has motivated the creation of better
abstractions for writing parallel software, including structured parallelism
using nested algorithmic skeletons. Such approaches provide high-level
abstractions that avoid common problems, such as race conditions, and often
allow strong cost models to be defined. However, choosing a combination of
algorithmic skeletons that yields good parallel speedups for a program on some
specific parallel architecture remains a difficult task. In order to achieve
this, it is necessary to simultaneously reason both about the costs of
different parallel structures and about the semantic equivalences between them.
This paper presents a new type-based mechanism that enables strong static
reasoning about these properties. We exploit well-known properties of a very
general recursion pattern, hylomorphisms, and give a denotational semantics for
structured parallel processes in terms of these hylomorphisms. Using our
approach, it is possible to determine formally whether it is possible to
introduce a desired parallel structure into a program without altering its
functional behaviour, and also to choose a version of that parallel structure
that minimises some given cost model.
