In this paper we present a work in progress on the formal verification of a
process supervisor using the McErlang model checker. The process supervisor is
an alternative implementation of the standard supervisor behaviour of
Erlang/OTP. This implementation, currently employed at the company
LambdaStream, was checked against several safety and liveness properties.
