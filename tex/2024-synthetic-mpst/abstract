Towards A Synthetic Formulation of Multiparty Session Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The theory of Multiparty Session Types (MPST) provides a formalism for specifying message-passing communication protocols among multiple participants, as well as for verifying processes against their roles in these protocols. A typical MPST workflow involves defining a global type (which specifies the global protocol), then "extracting" or projecting the "local behaviour" (local types) of the individual participants, and finally ensuring that process implementations conform to their corresponding local types through mechanisms such as type-checking, code generation, or dynamic monitoring. However, the classic formulation of MPST presents several challenges: it is closely tied to the syntax of global and local types, depends on a complex (albeit simple) definition of the projection operation, and is difficult to extend with more expressive protocol constructs.

In this talk, I will present a new, work-in-progress formulation of MPST, based on the approach by Jongmans and Ferreira (2023), which exclusively utilises the semantics of global types. This approach avoids the issues associated with the syntactic nature of the classic MPST formulation. The objectives of this work are threefold: (1) to decouple the presentation of MPST from the syntactic constructs of global/local types and projection; (2) to demonstrate that a semantic approach simplifies the presentation of MPST and yields more straightforward correctness proofs; and (3) to show that the well-behavedness and well-formedness predicates introduced by Jongmans and Ferreira (2023), as well as the classic "projectability implies well-formedness" property, are subsumed by type inhabitation within our framework. Our work is fully mechanised in Agda.
