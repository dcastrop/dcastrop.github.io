**Site in progress:** I am still updating this site. Please reach out if 
you have further questions.

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the 
[University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/computing/people/3664/castro-perez-david)
since 2021.  Prior to this, I worked as a Research Associate at 
[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) 
as part of the
[Mobility Reading Group](https://mrg.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/david-castro/).
I did my PhD at the
[University of St. Andrews](https://blogs.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/csblog/2017/11/10/phd-viva-success-david-castro/),
where I was part of the then called Functional Programming Group (today known
as the 
[Programming Languages Research group](https://plrg.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/)).

# Research Interests

I am interested in _interactive theorem proving_, _programming language design
and implementation_, _concurrency and distribution_, and _parallelism_. 

<hr>

My [research](/research) involves applying programming language-based
techniques to the development of safe and predictable systems, with a strong
emphasis on concurrent and distributed systems. I develop and apply techniques
based on behavioural types for reasoning about functional (e.g.  correctness)
and extra-functional (e.g. cost) of concurrent and distributed systems. I
developed high-level frameworks for parallel programming that provide
guarantees of correctness by construction, and I developed static cost analysis
for predicting the potential achievable speedups. Additionally, I am very
interested in build certified tools and languages, mostly in (but not limited
to) the Coq interactive theorem prover.

# PhD Vacancies

I am looking for a PhD student to work on session types, interactive theorem
proving for concurrency and distribution, or high-level parallel programming
frameworks.
